      <p>Whenever you see the following message you have to enter a valid license key for the camunda BPM platform. By selecting the link you will be forwarded to the license activation.</p>
      <p>The license check will be performed for each engine with an own database. Thus you will be promped to enter a license for each engine separately. In a clustered scenario where multiple engines on multiple nodes accessing a single database the license has to be activated only once. When activated a license is valid until the expiration date appears or until you have deleted your database. The license key is valid for an unlimited number of engines.</p>
