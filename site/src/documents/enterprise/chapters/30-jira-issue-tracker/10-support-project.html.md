On base of our Service Level Agreement you have the chance to address your questions, wishes and problems to our support service.


## Create a support ticket

We distinguish three types of issues:

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
  <tr class="success">
    <th>Issue Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Important Notes</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Bug Report<img class="img-responsive" src="ref:asset:/assets/img/jira-support/jira-bug.png"/></td>
    <td>File a bug report if a feature of the system doesn't work properly.</td>
    <td>Do not file missing features as bug request, even if you think that is a really vital feature that makes the product unusable without it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Feature Request<img class="img-responsive" src="ref:asset:/assets/img/jira-support/jira-newfeature.png"/></td>
    <td>Any missing features can be filed here.</td>
    <td>A feature request might be declined with some reasoning why this will not be part of the product. Otherwise it is usually pulled on the road-map and we inform you about status changes. Please add some information about your use case and why this feature is important to you.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Help Request<img class="img-responsive" src="ref:asset:/assets/img/jira-support/jira-help.png"/></td>
    <td>File any questions you have as help requests that are unrelated to any bug or feature request.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You can prioritize issues. Please note according to your SLA's a prioritization is possible for bug tickets only. Feature Requests and Help Requests are always prioritized as default.

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
  <tr class="success">
    <th>Priority Level</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Important Notes</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>L1 <img class="img-responsive" src="ref:asset:/assets/img/jira-support/jira-blocker.png"/>blocker</td>
    <td>Core components (i.e. process engine) of camunda BPM do not work at all / produce critical errors that prevent usage in production mode.</td>
    <td>Bug Tickets only! Production mode only!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>L2 <img class="img-responsive" src="ref:asset:/assets/img/jira-support/jira-major.png"/>critical</td>
    <td>Usage of camunda BPM seriously affected, a workaround is urgently needed. </td>
    <td>Bug Tickets only!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>L3 <img class="img-responsive" src="ref:asset:/assets/img/jira-support/jira-minor.png"/>default</td>
    <td>Non-critical errors, help requests, feature requests</td>
    <td>Bug Tickets, Feature Requests, Help Requests</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To create a new support ticket follow the instructions below. To shorten the processing time please provide us as much information as possible.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img data-img-thumb src="ref:asset:/assets/img/jira-support/jira-support-create-support-issue.png" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    <p>
      Go to our <a href="https://app.camunda.com/jira/browse/SUPPORT">JIRA support system</a> and select <code>Create Issue</code>. Select <code>Support</code> as project and choose the desired issue type. Give the ticket a meaningful <code>Summary</code>. You can give your ticket a <code>Priority</code> depending on how urgent the issue is for you. Provide us a date in terms of important <code>deadlines</code>. Enter a detailed <code>description</code> of your issue. In case of <b>Bug Reports</b> please use the template (<b>Reproduce steps</b>, <b>Problem</b>, <b>Expected behavior</b>, etc.). <code>Attachments</code> like screenshots, log files or BPMN files help us to find your bug faster. You can add <code>Authorized support contacts</code> if you want to share the tickets with your colleagues.

## Visibility of JIRA tickets

JIRA tickets will be shared with all your support contacts automatically. 

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-3">
    <img data-img-thumb src="ref:asset:/assets/img/jira-support/jira-watcher.png" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-9">
    <p>
      By clicking the watcher bubble you can see who is following the ticket. Here you can add or remove watchers. Please note you can only add users which are entitled camunda enterprise support contacts, otherwise you will get an error message that the user with that email address is not found.
