    <p>Unresolved incidents of a process instance or a sub process instance are indicated by Cockpit as failed jobs. To localize which instance of a process failed cockpit allows you to drill down to the unresolved incident by using the process status dots. Hit a red status dot of the affected instance in the Process Definitions View to get an overview about all incidents. The `incidents` tab in the <a href="ref:#cockpit-process-instance-detail-view">Detailed Information Panel</a> lists the failed activities with additional information. Furthermore you have the chance to go down the failing instance of a sub process.</p>
