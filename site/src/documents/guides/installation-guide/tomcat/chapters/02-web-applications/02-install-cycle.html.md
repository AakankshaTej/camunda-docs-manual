  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
  <p>With Camunda BPM 7.2.0 we have migrated Camunda Cycle into a standalone project. We did this to reduce the tight coupling between Camunda Cycle and the Camunda BPM platform. This eases our development efforts for Cycle and allows others to increase participation.
  If you are looking for an installation guide for Camunda Cycle, please see <a href="http://docs.camunda.org/7.1/guides/installation-guide/tomcat/#web-applications-install-camunda-cycle">this section</a> on the 7.1 branch. We will publish more news here, through our newsletter and on our <a href="http://blog.camunda.org/">blog</a>.</p>
