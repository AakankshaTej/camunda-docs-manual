  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
  <p>We are sorry, but currently we migrate camunda Cycle into a standalone project. We do this to lessen the tight coupling between camunda Cycle and the camunda bpm platform. This will ease our development efforts for cycle and allows others to increase their participation.
  When you are looking for an installation guide please see <a href="http://docs.camunda.org/7.1/guides/installation-guide/tomcat/#web-applications-install-camunda-cycle">here</a> for the 7.1 one. Stay put for an update here, through our newsletter or our <a href="http://blog.camunda.org/">blog</a>.</p>
