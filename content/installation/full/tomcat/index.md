This document describes the installation of the [Full Distribution]({{< relref "user-guide/introduction/downloading-camunda.md#full-distribution" >}}) for [Apache Tomcat 7 Application Server](http://tomcat.apache.org/).

There are different options for installing the Full Distribution:

## Install the Pre-Packaged Distribution

Installing the pre-packaged distribution is the easiest way to get started. The pre-packaged distribution provides a Tomcat Application Server itself with all the Camunda librarires and web applications pre-installed and pre-configured.

[Install the pre-packaged distribution]({{< relref "installation/full/tomcat/pre-packaged.md" >}}).

## Manual Installation

If you want to add the Full Distribution to an existing tomcat installation, you need to perform the installation steps manually.

[Install the Full Distribution for Tomcat manually]({{< relref "installation/full/tomcat/manual.md" >}}).

## Configuration

After you have completed either of the above installation procedures, you can perform a number of optional configuration steps.

[Configure the Full Distribution for Tomcat]({{< relref "installation/full/tomcat/configuration.md" >}}).
