This document describes the installation of the [Full Distribution]({{< relref "user-guide/introduction/downloading-camunda.md#full-distribution" >}}) for [Glassfish 3.1 Application Server](http://glassfish.java.net/).

There are different options for installing the Full Distribution:

## Install the Pre-Packaged Distribution

Installing the pre-packaged distribution is the easiest way to get started. The pre-packaged distribution provides Glassfish Application Server itself with all the Camunda librarires and web applications pre-installed and pre-configured.

## Manual Installation

If you want to add the Full Distribution to an existing Glassfish installation, you need to perform the installation steps manually.

## Configuration

After you have completed either of the above installation procedures, you can perform a number of optional configuration steps.
