Tasks can be directly assigned to a user or to a group. Compared to the direct assignment of tasks, the tasks of groups are not yet assigned. They must be claimed before a user can work on the form. Depending on this affiliation the Tasklist displays tasks in different [filters]({{< relref "webapps/tasklist/filters.md" >}}).
