# Download and Installation

{{< note title="Before you start" class="info" >}}
Make sure you have the following set of tools installed:

* Java JDK 1.6+
* Apache Maven (optional, if not installed you can use embedded Maven inside eclipse.)
* A modern Web browser (recent Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer 9+ will work fine)

{{< /note >}}


## Install camunda BPM platform

First, download a distribution of the camunda BPM platform. You can choose from different distributions for various application servers. In this tutorial, we will use the Apache Tomcat 7 based distribution. Download it [here](http://camunda.org/download).

After having downloaded the distribution, unpack it inside a directory of your choice. We will call that directory `$CAMUNDA_HOME`.

After you have successfully unpacked your distribution of the camunda BPM platform, execute the script named `start-camunda.bat` (for Windows users), respectively `start-camunda.sh` (for Unix users).

This script will start the application server and open a welcome screen in your Web browser. If the page does not open, go to [http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index.html](http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index.html).

{{< note title="Getting Help" class="info" >}}
If you have trouble setting up the camunda BPM platform, you can ask for assistance in the [User Forum](http://camunda.org/community/forum.html).
{{< /note >}}

## Install the camunda Modeler

Follow the instructions in the [camunda Modeler]({{< relref "installation/eclipse-plugin.md" >}}) section.

# Set up your project

Now you are ready to set up your first process application project in eclipse. Setting up a process application project consists of 4 steps:  

1. Create a new Maven Project in Eclipse
2. Add the camunda dependencies
3. Add a `@ProcessApplication` class
4. Add a META-INF/processes.xml deployment descriptor

In the following sections, we go through this process step by step.

## Create a new Maven Project in Eclipse

In eclipse, go to `File / New / Other ...`. This opens the *New Project Wizard*. In the *New Project Wizard* select `Maven / Maven Project`. Click Next.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/eclipse-new-project.png" >}}

On the first page of the *New Maven Project Wizard* select *Create a simple project (skip archetype selection)*. Click Next.

On the second page (see screenshot), configure the Maven coordinates for the project. Since we are setting up a WAR Project, make sure to select `Packaging: war`.
 
When you are done, click Finish. Eclipse sets up a new Maven project. The project appears in the *Project Explorer* View.

## Add camunda Maven Dependencies

The next step consists of setting up the Maven dependencies for your new process application. Add the following dependencies to the `pom.xml` file of your project:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.getstarted</groupId>
  <artifactId>loan-approval</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <packaging>war</packaging>

  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
        <artifactId>camunda-bom</artifactId>
        <version>7.3.0</version>
        <scope>import</scope>
        <type>pom</type>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
      <artifactId>camunda-engine</artifactId>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
      <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
      <version>3.0.1</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.3</version>
        <configuration>
          <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>

</project>
```

Now you can perform the first build. Select the `pom.xml` in the Package Explorer, perform a right-click and select `Run As / Maven Install`.

## Add a Process Application Class

Next, you need to create a package, e.g. `org.camunda.bpm.getstarted.loanapproval` and add a Process Application class to it. The Process Application class constitutes the interface between your application and the process engine.

```java
package org.camunda.bpm.getstarted.loanapproval;

import org.camunda.bpm.application.ProcessApplication;
import org.camunda.bpm.application.impl.ServletProcessApplication;

@ProcessApplication("Loan Approval App")
public class LoanApprovalApplication extends ServletProcessApplication {
  // empty implementation
}
```

## Add a META-INF/processes.xml deployment descriptor

The last step to set up the process application is to add the `META-INF/processes.xml` deployment descriptor file. This file allows us to provide a declarative configuration of the deployment(s) this process application makes to the process engine.

This file needs to be added to the `src/main/resources/META-INF` folder of the Maven project.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

<process-application
    xmlns="http://www.camunda.org/schema/1.0/ProcessApplication"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

  <process-archive name="loan-approval">
    <process-engine>default</process-engine>
    <properties>
      <property name="isDeleteUponUndeploy">false</property>
      <property name="isScanForProcessDefinitions">true</property>
    </properties>
  </process-archive>

</process-application>
```

{{< note title="Empty META-INF/processes.xml" class="info" >}}
You can leave the META-INF/processes.xml file empty. In that case, default values are used. See the <a href="ref:/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-the-processesxml-deployment-descriptor-empty-processesxml">Empty Processes.xml</a> section of the <a href="ref:/guides/user-guide/">User Guide</a> for more information
{{< /note >}}


At this point you have successfully set up the process application and you can start modeling the first process.

{{< get-tag repo="camunda-get-started" tag="Step-2" >}}

# Model a Process

In this section you learn how to create your first BPMN 2.0 process with the camunda Modeler.

## Create a new BPMN Diagram

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/eclipse-new-bpmn-diagram.png" >}}

In the eclipse *Package Explorer* select the `src/main/resources` folder. Right-click and select *New > Other ...*.
Go to the folder *BPMN* and select *BPMN 2.0 Diagram*. Click Next.

On the second page, you must specify the file name of the process. Insert `loan-approval.bpmn`. Click Finish.

## Start with a Simple Process

Start by modeling a simple process. From the Palette on the right hand side of the canvas, drag a *Start Event* onto the canvas.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/eclipse-simple-process.png" >}}

Double-click on the Start Event. A text box opens. Type "Loan Request Received".

{{< note title="Hint" class="info" >}}
When editing Labels, you can add line breaks by hitting `Shift + Enter`.
{{< /note >}}

Add a User Task to the process. Name it *Approve Loan*. Add an End Event named *Loan Request Approved*.

## Configure a User Task

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/eclipse-simple-process-property.png" >}}

Next, Open the properties view. If the properties view is not visible, select it from the menu: *Window / Show View / Other ...* This opens a dialog. From the dialog select *Properties*.

Select the User Task on the canvas. This updates the selection in the Properties View. Scroll to the Property named `Assignee`.
Type *john*.

When you are done, save your changes.

## Configure Properties for Execution

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/eclipse-simple-process-config.png" >}}

Since we are modeling an executable process, we should give it an ID and set the `isExecutable` property to `true`. Open the properties view and click on a free spot of the modeling canvas. This displays the properties of the process itself.

First, configure an ID for the process. Type *approve-loan* in the property field *Process Id*. The property ID is used by the process engine as identifier for the executable process and it is best practice to set it to a human-readable name.

Second, configure the Name of the process. Type *Loan Approval* in the property field *Name*.

Finally, check the box of the *Is Executable* property. If you do not check this box, the process definition is ignored by the process engine.

When you are done, save your changes.

{{< get-tag repo="camunda-get-started" tag="Step-3" >}}

# Deploy the Process Application

A Process Application is an ordinary Java Web Application and is deployed in exactly the same way.

Select the `pom.xml` in the Package Explorer, perform a right-click and select `Run As / Maven Install`. This will generate a WAR file named `loan-approval-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war` In the `target/` folder of your Maven project.

{{< note title="Hint" class="info" >}}
If the `loan-approval-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war` file is not visible after having performed the Maven build, you need to refresh the project (F5) in eclipse.
{{< /note >}}

## Deploy to Apache Tomcat

In order to deploy the process application, copy-paste the `loan-approval-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war` from your Maven project to the `$CAMUNDA_HOME/server/apache-tomcat/webapps` folder.

Check the log file of the Apache Tomcat server. If you see the following log message, the deployment was successful:

<pre class="console">
org.camunda.bpm.application.impl.ServletProcessApplicationDeployer onStartup
INFORMATION: Detected @ProcessApplication class org.camunda.bpm.getstarted.loanapproval.LoanApprovalApplication

Deployment does not provide any case definitions.
org.camunda.bpm.container.impl.RuntimeContainerDelegateImpl deployProcessApplication
INFORMATION: Process Application Loan Approval App successfully deployed.
</pre>

## Check with camunda Cockpit

Now use Cockpit to check if the process is successfully deployed. Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/cockpit" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/cockpit</a>. Log in with demo / demo. Your process *Loan Approval* is visible on the start screen.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/cockpit-loan-approval.png" >}}

## Start a process instance

Next, go to camunda Tasklist (<a href="http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist</a>). Click on the <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt"></i> Start process</button> button to start a process instance. This opens a dialog where you can select *Loan Approval* from the list. Now you can set variables for the process instance using a generic form.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/start-form-generic.png" >}}

The generic form can be used whenever you have not added a dedicated form for a User Task or a Start Event.
Click on the <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Add a variable</button> button to get a new row. Fill in the form as shown in the screenshot. When you are done, click <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Start</button>.

If you now go back to <a href="http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/cockpit" target="_blank">camunda Cockpit</a>, you see the newly created process instance that is waiting in the User Task.

## Configure Process Start Authorizations

To allow the user *john* to see the process definition *Loan Approval* you have to go to camunda Admin (<a href="http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/admin/default/#/authorization?resource=6" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/admin/default/#/authorization?resource=6</a>). Next, click on the button <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Create New</button> to add a new authorization on the resource *process definition*. Now you can give the user *john* all permissions on process definition *approve-loan*. When you are done, submit the new authorization.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/create-process-definition-authorization.png" >}}

For further details about authorizations and how to manage them please read the following sections in the user guide: <a href="ref:/guides/user-guide/#process-engine-authorization-service" target="_blank">Authorization Service</a> and <a href="ref:/guides/user-guide/#admin-authorization-management-authorizations" target="_blank">Authorizations</a>

## Work on the task

Log out of the Admin. Go to Tasklist (<a href="http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist</a>) and log back in with the user credentials "john / john". Now you see the *Approve Loan* task in your Tasklist. Select the task and click on the `Diagram` tab. This displays the process diagram highlighting the User Task that is waiting for you to work on it.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/diagram.png" >}}

To work on the task, select the `Form` tab. Again, there is no task form associated with the process. Click on <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Load Variables</button>. This displays the variables you have put in in the first step.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/task-form-generic.png" >}}

# Add Forms

In the next step, we want to add an actual Task Form.

## Add a Start Form

Go back to eclipse and add a folder named `src/main/webapp/forms`. Inside this folder, add a file named `request-loan.html`. Add the following content:

```html
<form name="requestLoan">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="customerId">Customer ID</label>
    <input class="form-control" cam-variable-type="String" cam-variable-name="customerId" name="customerId"/>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="amount">Amount</label>
    <input class="form-control" cam-variable-type="Double" cam-variable-name="amount" name="amount"/>
  </div>
</form>
```

Open the process with the modeler plugin. Click on the start event. In the properties view, insert `embedded:app:forms/request-loan.html` into the `Form Key` property field. This means that we want to use an `embedded` form inside the Tasklist and that the form is loaded from the `app`lication.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/eclipse-configure-start-form.png" >}}

## Add a Task Form

The Task Form can be added and configured the same way. Add a file named `approve-loan.html` to the `src/main/webapp/forms` directory and add the following content:

```html
<form name="approveLoan">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="customerId">Customer ID</label>
    <input class="form-control" cam-variable-type="String" cam-variable-name="customerId" name="customerId" readonly="true"/>
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="amount">Amount</label>
    <input class="form-control" cam-variable-type="Double" cam-variable-name="amount" name ="amount"/>
  </div>
</form>
```

After that, open the process with the modeler plugin again. Click on the user task. In the properties view, insert `embedded:app:forms/approve-loan.html` into the `Form Key` property field.

When you are done, save all resources, perform a Maven build and redeploy the process application.

{{< note title="Maven" class="info" >}}
It is best practice to perform a `clean install` build to make sure all resources are replaced with their newest version.
{{< /note >}}

Now you can open the Tasklist and start a new process instance for the loan approval process. You will notice that the custom form is displayed.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/start-form-embedded.png" >}}

After starting a new process instance a new task `Approve Loan` is assigned to john. To work on the task, select the task inside the list of tasks and you will also notice that the custom form is displayed.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/task-form-embedded.png" >}}

{{< get-tag repo="camunda-get-started" tag="Step-4" >}}

# Add a Service Task

In the last section of this tutorial we add some code to the process.

## Add a Service Task to the Process

Use the camunda modeler plugin in eclipse to add a service task after the user task. The service task can be dropped on a sequence flow (see screenshot).

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/eclipse-add-service-task.png" >}}

## Add a JavaDelegate Implementation

Now we need to add the actual service task implementation. Add a class named `ProcessRequestDelegate` implementing the `JavaDelegate` interface:

```java
public class ProcessRequestDelegate implements JavaDelegate {

  private final static Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger("LOAN-REQUESTS");

  public void execute(DelegateExecution execution) throws Exception {
    LOGGER.info("Processing request by '"+execution.getVariable("customerId")+"'...");
  }

}
```
<div class="app-source" data-source-code="ProcessRequestDelegate" annotate="code-annotations"></div>

## Configure the Class in the Process

Use the properties view to reference the Service Task in the process (see screenshot). You need to provide the fully qualified classname of your class in the `class` property field.

{{< img src="../img/bpmn20/eclipse-configure-service.png" >}}

Build, deploy and execute the process. After completing the *Approve Application* step, check the logfile of the Apache Tomcat server:

<pre class="console">
org.camunda.bpm.getstarted.loanapproval.ProcessRequestDelegate execute
INFORMATION: Processing request by 'AC-343422'...
</pre>

{{< note title="Classloading with a shared process engine" >}}
The process engine resolves the ProcessRequestDelegate class from the application classloader. This allows you to

* have a different classloader for each Process Application,
* bundle libraries inside your application,
* (re-)deploy the application at runtime (without stopping / restarting the process engine).

{{< /note >}}

{{< get-tag repo="camunda-get-started" tag="Step-5" >}}

# Done!
