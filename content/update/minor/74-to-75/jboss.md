The following steps describe how to upgrade the Camunda artifacts on a JBoss AS
7 and Wildfly 8 server in a shared process engine setting. For the entire
procedure, refer to the [upgrade guide][upgrade-guide]. If not
already done, make sure to download the [Camunda BPM 7.5 JBoss distribution][jboss-distro]
or [Camunda BPM 7.5 Wildfly distribution][wildfly-distro]. In the following instructions
`$APP_SERVER` should be replaced with either `jboss` or `wildfly`, depending on
the used application server.

The upgrade procedure takes the following steps:

1. Upgrade the Camunda BPM Modules
2. Upgrade Optional Camunda BPM Modules
3. Maintain Process Engine Configuration
4. Maintain Process Applications
5. Upgrade Camunda Web Applications

Whenever the instructions are to *replace* a module, make sure to delete the previous version of the module first to avoid orphan jars.

# 1. Upgrade the Camunda BPM Modules

Replace the following modules from the folder `$APP_SERVER_HOME/modules/` with their new versions from the folder `$APP_SERVER_DISTRIBUTION/modules/`:

* `org/camunda/bpm/camunda-engine`
* `org/camunda/bpm/$APP_SERVER/camunda-$APP_SERVER-subsystem`
* `org/camunda/bpm/model/camunda-bpmn-model`
* `org/camunda/bpm/model/camunda-cmmn-model`
* `org/camunda/bpm/model/camunda-xml-model`

Add or replace (if already present) the following modules:

* `org/camunda/bpm/dmn/camunda-engine-dmn`
* `org/camunda/bpm/dmn/camunda-engine-feel-api`
* `org/camunda/bpm/dmn/camunda-engine-feel-juel`
* `org/camunda/bpm/model/camunda-dmn-model`
* `org/camunda/commons/camunda-commons-logging`
* `org/camunda/commons/camunda-commons-typed-values`
* `org/camunda/commons/camunda-commons-utils`

# 2. Upgrade Optional Camunda BPM Modules

In addition to the core modules, there may be optional artifacts in `$APP_SERVER_HOME/modules/` for LDAP integration, Camunda Connect, Camunda Spin, and Groovy scripting.
If you use any of these extensions, the following upgrade steps apply:

## LDAP Integration

Replace the following modules from the folder `$APP_SERVER_HOME/modules/` with their new versions from the folder `$APP_SERVER_DISTRIBUTION/modules/`, if present:

* `org/camunda/bpm/identity/camunda-identity-ldap`

## Camunda Connect

Replace the following modules from the folder `$APP_SERVER_HOME/modules/` with their new versions from the folder `$APP_SERVER_DISTRIBUTION/modules/`, if present:

* `org/camunda/bpm/camunda-engine-plugin-connect`

## Camunda Spin

Replace the following modules from the folder `$APP_SERVER_HOME/modules/` with their new versions from the folder `$APP_SERVER_DISTRIBUTION/modules/`, if present:

* `org/camunda/spin/camunda-spin-core`
* `org/camunda/spin/camunda-spin-dataformat-json-jackson`
* `org/camunda/spin/camunda-spin-dataformat-xml-dom`
* `org/camunda/bpm/camunda-engine-plugin-spin`

## Groovy Scripting

Replace the following modules from the folder `$APP_SERVER_HOME/modules/` with their new versions from the folder `$APP_SERVER_DISTRIBUTION/modules/` if present:

* `org/codehaus/groovy/groovy-all`

# 3. Maintain Process Engine Configuration

This section describes changes in the engineâ€™s default behavior. While the change is reasonable, your implementation may rely on the previous default behavior. Thus, the previous behavior can be restored for shared process engines by explicitly setting a configuration option.

<< Add necessary process engine configuration changes as subsections here >>

# 4. Maintain Process Applications

This section describes changes in behavior of API methods that your process applications may rely on.

<< Add necessary application changes as subsections here >>

# 5. Upgrade Camunda Web Applications

## Upgrade REST API

The following steps are required to upgrade the Camunda REST API on a JBoss/Wildfly instance:

1. Undeploy an existing web application with a name like `camunda-engine-rest`
2. Download the REST API web application archive from our [Maven Nexus Server][engine-rest]. Alternatively, switch to the private repository for
   the enterprise version (User and password from license required). Choose the correct version named `$PLATFORM_VERSION/camunda-engine-rest-$PLATFORM_VERSION.war`.
3. Deploy the web application archive to your JBoss/Wildfly instance.

## Upgrade Cockpit, Tasklist, and Admin

The following steps are required to upgrade the Camunda web applications Cockpit, Tasklist, and Admin on a JBoss/Wildfly instance:

1. Undeploy an existing web application with a name like `camunda-webapp`
2. Download the Camunda web application archive from our [Maven Nexus Server][webapp-jboss].
   Alternatively, switch to the private repository for the enterprise version (User and password from license required).
   Choose the correct version named `$PLATFORM_VERSION/camunda-webapp-jboss.war`.
3. Deploy the web application archive to your JBoss/Wildfly instance.
